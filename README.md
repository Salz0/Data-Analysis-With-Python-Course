# Data-Analysis-With-Python-Course

The first chapter of the "Python for Data Analysis & Visualization" course will focus on introducing the necessary tools and libraries for data analysis and visualization in Python. The chapter will include examples and instructions for installing and setting up Python, Jupyter notebooks, and the most commonly used libraries for data analysis and visualization.

### Getting Started
Installing Python
Before we can start working with data in Python, we need to make sure that we have Python installed on our system. If you don't already have Python installed, you can download and install it from the official Python website.

### Installing Jupyter Notebooks
In this course, we will be using Jupyter notebooks as a platform for writing and running our Python code. Jupyter notebooks are an interactive environment that allows us to write and run code, as well as add text, images, and other types of media to our notebooks.

To install Jupyter notebooks, we can use the pip package manager that comes with Python. Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command:

```
pip install jupyter
```
### Installing Libraries for Data Analysis and Visualization
In this course, we will be using several popular libraries for data analysis and visualization in Python. These libraries include:

* NumPy: A library for working with numerical data and arrays
* Pandas: A library for working with tabular data
* Matplotlib: A library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
* Seaborn: A library for creating statistical visualizations
To install these libraries, we can use the pip package manager. Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following commands:

```
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
```
### Examples and Code Tasks
Once we have Python, Jupyter notebooks, and the necessary libraries installed, we are ready to start working with data in Python. Let's start by opening a Jupyter notebook and importing the libraries that we will be using.

```py
# Import the necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```
### Importing and Exploring Data
The first step in working with data in Python is to import it into our Jupyter notebook. We can use the pandas library to easily read in data from a file and store it in a DataFrame object.

```py
# Import the data into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame
df.head()
```

Once we have our data in a DataFrame, we can start exploring it to get a better understanding of the data and its structure. We can use the describe() method to get some basic statistics about the data, such as the count, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values, etc.

```py
# Get some basic statistics about the data
df.describe()
```
### Visualizing Data
One of the most powerful aspects of Python for data analysis and visualization is its ability to create beautiful and interactive visualizations of data. We can


use the matplotlib and seaborn libraries to create a wide range of visualizations, from simple line and bar plots to more complex scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps.

For example, we can create a simple line plot of the data using the plot() method.

```py
# Create a line plot of the data
df.plot()
plt.show()
```
Or, we can create a scatter plot using the scatter() method.

```py
# Create a scatter plot of the data
df.plot.scatter(x='x', y='y')
plt.show()
```
### Code Tasks
To help you practice working with data in Python, try completing the following code tasks:

1. Import a different dataset and print the first 10 rows of the data using the head() method.
2. Use the describe() method to get some basic statistics about the data.
3. Create a histogram of one of the columns in the data using the hist() method.
4. Create a heatmap of the data using the heatmap() method.

Remember to use the examples and instructions in this chapter as a guide to help you complete the tasks. Good luck!
